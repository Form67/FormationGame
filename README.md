Scalable-

Used Cone Check for collision avoidance.  We used a defensive circle formation (all units faced outwards) and the leader is one of the boids in the circle.

For the tunnels, Scalable was able to get through the 3 wide just with cone check, but the 1 wide each boid takes turns in order of distance from the entrance seeking through the tunnel.


Emergent-

Used Cone Check for collision avoidance with the terrain and each boid tried to move to a certain point based on parameters. No boid had full knowledge of all other boids.

For the tunnels, Emergent was able to get through the 3 wide just with cone check, but the 1 wide each boid takes turns in order of distance from the entrance seeking through the tunnel.
